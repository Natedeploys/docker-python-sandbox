## Jupyter Notebook ready with NLP libraries

1. Install docker on your machine.
2. Using the command line, CD into this folder and build once:

docker-compose up --build

3. Access the jupyter notebook at:

http://localhost:8080

4. Use the token at the end of the url provided at the command line to log in to jupyter

## Troubleshooting

- If you are using linux, you might be required to use sudo before the step 2 command
- If no docker daemon is present, it means either the above or docker needs to be installed
